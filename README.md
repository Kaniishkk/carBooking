Iâ€™m a passionate MERN Stack Developer with a strong interest in building scalable and user-friendly web applications. Recently, I designed and developed a full-featured Car Booking Application using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

ðŸ”§ Key Features Implemented:

Real-time car availability filtering

User authentication & secure booking flow

Admin panel for managing listings, users, and bookings

Responsive UI for seamless experience across devices

I focused on delivering an intuitive UX while ensuring code quality, modularity, and scalability. This project not only strengthened my full-stack development skills but also gave me deeper insights into deployment, API optimization, and state management.

I'm eager to connect with like-minded developers, work on impactful projects, and keep growing in the world of full-stack web development.
